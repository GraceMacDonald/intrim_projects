LeaveTaken_Bonus.ipynb
The purpose of this report is to analyze the relationship between annual leave and bonuses for employees, using data from the AdventureWorks2019 database. The objective is to provide stakeholders with insights into how annual leave allocation impacts bonus payments.

Analysis:

This analysis involved querying the AdventureWorks2019 database to retrieve data on annual leave and bonuses.

Results:

The analysis found a strong correlation between vacation hours and bonuses that employees receive. From this we can conclude that vacation hours have a positive effect on the performance of employees, as well as on their bonuses paid for work. Employees who have minimum vacation hours either receive no bonuses at all or receive very few bonuses. There is also an inverse correlation - people who rest more are more motivated to work and to do it in less time, bringing profit to the company and receiving bonuses.

Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that there is a positive relationship between annual leave and bonus payments. The analysis clearly advises the company to evaluate its vacation hours policy, since the relationship between performance and bonuses is quite strong. This will also help improve employee motivation and the quality of their work.Further investigations and adjustments based on these findings can contribute to the overall success and well-being of the workforce.
